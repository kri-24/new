    <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>
    <p>AI has applications in various fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. For example, AI powers recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix and helps in medical diagnostics.</p>
    <p>Key types of AI include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Designed for specific tasks, like voice assistants (e.g., Siri).</li>
        <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Hypothetical AI with human-like intelligence across domains.</li>
        <li><strong>Superintelligent AI:</strong> AI that surpasses human intelligence, a topic of ongoing debate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI is evolving rapidly, with advancements in deep learning and neural networks driving innovations. However, it also raises ethical concerns like privacy, bias, and job displacement.</p>
